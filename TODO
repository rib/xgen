screen object
  - black color
  - white color
  - root xid
  - root visual
  - root depth

gtk-doc the screen property accessors

implement gx_pixmap_new and gx_gcontext_new

rename "connection_" namespace
For the window object we should rename requests like gx_window_map_window to
gx_window_map. Do the same for other objects as appropriate.

split xgen API out from gx-gen.c

continue implementing rendertest as a way to identify issues with the API

tests:
- test the GError mechanisms work
- test pixmap creation and drawing

GXGen improvements:
- improve the namespacing abstractions in gx-gen
- identify query version requests and generate function like the typical
hand coded versions.

Lame thoughs about namespacing:

current idea is to have a very short prefix, given that the API is broken
into a number of objects which already have long/descriptive names

  /* glib/gnome X */
  gx_window_new();

  /* Z's and X's always sound cool... */
  xx_window_new();
  zx_window_new();

  /* object oriented X */
  ox_window_new();
  oox_window_new();

  /* A change in the way we program X (delta x)... */
  dx_window_new();

  /* If we can't just use 'x_' 'ex_' sounds the same, great!... */
  ex_window_new();

  /* fd.o x? free X, bleh, flibble x */
  fx_window_new();
