How:
----

You should including the following at the top of your new unit test:
#include "test-gx-common.h"

Instead of a main () function add an entry point with a prototype as follows:

void
test_blah (TestGXSimpleFixture *fixture,
           gconstpointer data)
{

}

Add a TEST_CONFORM_SIMPLE() entry in test-conform-main.c


Notes:
------

NB: A test fails if it exists. (regardless of the exist status)
